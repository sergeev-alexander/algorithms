// 2452. Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary
public class a2452 {

    You are given two string arrays, queries and dictionary. All words in each array
    comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.
    In one edit you can take a word from queries, and change any letter in it to any other letter.
    Find all words from queries that, after a maximum of two edits, equal some word from dictionary.
    Return a list of all words from queries, that match with some word from dictionary after a maximum of two edits.
    Return the words in the same order they appear in queries.
